# Terminal Customization

Terminal is configured with the oh-my-posh theme for the use.

Once the terminal is configured, it looks like this

## Additional Packages used

- z
  - For display of the History
- Terminal-Icons
  - For display of glyphs against the files

## Note

Install the Terminal application and set the Powershell as the default profile.\
_Windows 11 has Terminal built-in_

Run the ps1 file only in the terminal after setting the Powershell as the default profile.
